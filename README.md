# Landing Page

## Description

A modern-looking landing page (design provided by The Odin Project) using HTML, 
CSS, and Flexbox.

## Self-Reflection

Completing this project was a valuable experience in basic frontend 
development. Being provided a design and then implementing it using HTML and 
CSS gave me a feel for what it's like to do frontend development. I got to put 
into practice what I've learned so far with HTML, CSS, and especially Flexbox 
in this project with the various layouts I had to apply to each section of the 
page.
